Sample Docker configuration for `eos-bios` launch
-------------------------------------------------

This directory contains all the files necessary for a launch, be it
booting a network or joining an existing network.  You can also use it
for local development.

Table of contents:

* `my_discovery_file.yaml` is the file representing you in the network
  you are creating/joining. It includes the votes (`peers`) to other
  BPs you wish to launch the network with. It also includes references
  to the contents you want to inject in the nascent chain (like smart
  contracts, snapshots, etc..)

* `publish_discovery_file.sh` is a script you tweak to publish the
  `my_discovery_file.yaml` to a location of your choice.

* `hook_*` are the hooks used by `eos-bios` to automate your
  infrastructure configuration. The sample files start a Docker
  instance locally.

  * When running `boot`, these are executed in order: `hook_init`,
    `hook_boot_network`, `hook_publish_kickstart_data` and
    `hook_done`.

  * When running `join`, these are executed in order: `hook_init`,
    `hook_join_network`, `hook_done`.

* `base_config.ini`, the base configuration you want to provide to
  your `nodeos` instance. It is consume by the sample hooks, and
  shouldn't include any `private_key`, `enable-stale-production` or
  `producer-name` fields.

Some files generated by the sample hooks:
* `config.ini` is then passed to `docker` to configure `nodeos`.
* `genesis.json` is also passed to `docker` to seed the genesis blocks.
